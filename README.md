## Set up
1. clone the repo into {your ghost dir}/content/themes
2. cd into mini/ and run `yarn install`, this should install all dependencies you need to run the project
3. run `yarn dev`, this will compile all the css files in mini/assets/css/raw and put them in mini/assets/css/built and restart the ghost server. You should only make changes to css files in raw/.
4. run `yarn dev` every time you've made a change and would like to see the change reflected on the page
